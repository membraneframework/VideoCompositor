# `live-compositor`

This package provides a set of React components that can be used to define a composition of a video stream. Available components can only be used with React renderers specific for Live Compositor. Currently, we only support Node.js runtime with `@live-compositor/node` package, but support for more runtimes is planned in the future.

Live Compositor components should not be mixed with other React or React Native components, but you can still use hooks like `useState`/`useEffect` from React.

## Getting started

To try compositor generate started project by running:

```
npm create live-compositor
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { View, Text, InputStream, Rescaler } from 'live-compositor';

function ExampleApp() {
  return (
    <View style={{ direction: 'column' }}>
      <Rescaler style={{ rescaleMode: 'fill' }}>
        <InputStream inputId="example_input_1" />
      </Rescaler>
      <Text fontSize={20}>Example label</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
