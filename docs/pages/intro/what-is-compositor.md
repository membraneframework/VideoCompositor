# What is Live Compositor?

LiveCompositor is a media server for real-time, low latency, programmable video and audio mixing.

LiveCompositor targets real-time use cases, with a significant focus on situations where latency is critical. It is a great fit
for any video conferencing, live-streaming, or broadcasting solutions where you need to combine or modify video on the fly.
However, you can also use it for non-real-time use cases, for example, apply some effect on a video from an MP4 file and write the output
to file as MP4.
