# Get started

To familiarize yourself with a compositor you can start with `examples` directory. It includes example applications that use ffmpeg and ffplay to simulate compositor inputs and outputs. For a more detailed explanation of some of the terms used in this documentation, you can check [this page](https://github.com/membraneframework/video_compositor/wiki/Main-concepts).

Running examples requires:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [FFmpeg 6.0](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

You can launch an example by running:

```console
cargo run --release --example <example_name>
```

See language specific pages for more.
